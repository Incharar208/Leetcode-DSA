'''
* STORES ONLY UNIQUE VALUES 
* unordered collection of items
* s = set()
* index based retrieval is not possible in set
* accessing elements in set:
* for i in s:
      print(i)
* adding element in to set :
  s.add(10)
* OPERATIONS ON SET
1. UNION:
  Two sets s and r
  p = s.union(r)
2. INTERSECTION:
  Two sets s and r
  p = s.intersection(r)
3. DIFFERENCE:
  Two sets s and r
  p = s,difference(r)
  s-r
